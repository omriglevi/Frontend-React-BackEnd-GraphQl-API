# Frontend-React-BackEnd-GraphQl-API
This is the  Frontend and Backend fof the project . The Frontend 
This project was built by React-Hooks .
I used Bootstrap4 for layout and some Components , Materials UI and Font Awsome icons . 

Backend : 
-This backend's API was built using GraphQL - the API accepts POST methods only wich alows us to keep our queries secured .  
I used Referances for a perfect nested backend.
Password passed to the DB are encrypted by bcrypt

In This project I used mongoDB Atlas as my Database . I used Referances for my collections for perfect nesting and smooth pulling from the API , the usage of Referances andtypes allows
is to save data as a string/Id that can be then extracted into a JS objects on by the backend functionality .
